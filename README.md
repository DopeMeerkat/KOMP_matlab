# Instructions
- Make a folder that starts with the same extension as the filenames i.e. files are named `CCC_E11_hF_FL1_A_s1c1.jpg` so the folder will need to be named `CCC_E11_hF`
- run `python3 setup.py`
- run `python3 runMatlab.py`

- run `python3 filterThresholds.py`
- open `Threshold2/`folder and look through the images, make changes to any that needed touch ups and add a f to the filename, mark any unusable ones with u, and mark ones that need to be redone with r
i.e. `CCC_E11_hF_ML3_s2_2_shift3.jpg` -> `CCC_E11_hF_ML3_s2_2_shift3r.jpg`
